# The-Road

The 8th project from a Udemy course called 10 Mega Responsive Websites.

## Description

The 8th project from a Udemy course called 10 Mega Responsive Websites. This project is a mock travel website, greeting you with an inviting landing page that includes a hot air balloon taking you into the center of the page. The highlight of this page for me is the stories section with a video background. It was simpler to make than anticipated but still looks amazing.
